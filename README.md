# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

<br/>

This version of the rock, paper, scissors game that everyone is familiar with and puts a fun variation on the classic. The fundamentals are the same, you either win lose or draw with every go. The user makes a choice and this then competes against the choice the computer has generated. There are only three choices so the odds aren't completely stacked against you. In this game the rock option is replaced with "the-rock", the paper option is replaced with "paper-airplane" and the scissors option is replaced with "Edward-Scissorhands". The winner is determined on who reaches 5 first. It is a true battle of the odds with the computer.
