# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

<br/>

This version of the rock, paper, scissors game that everyone is familiar with and puts a fun variation on the classic. The fundamentals are the same, you either win lose or draw with every go. The user makes a choice and this then competes against the choice the computer has generated. There are only three choices so the odds aren't completely stacked against you. In this game the rock option is replaced with "the-rock", the paper option is replaced with "paper-airplane" and the scissors option is replaced with "Edward-Scissorhands". The winner is determined on who reaches 5 first. It is a true battle of the odds with the computer.

## Design

<br/>

### Colour Scheme

![Rock, Paper, Scissors Palette](assets/images/readme-images/rock-paper-scissors-coolors-palette.png)

<br/>

As there were images used as buttons and used for displaying the users/computers choice I chose to keep the colour scheme minimalistic. I added the radial gradient effect as to add a touch of styling without overwhelming the user. The splash of aquamarine is there in order for the site not to be completely made up of variants of white and black. The colour palette was created by using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

<br/>

### Typography

<br/>

The following two fonts were picked as they complimented each other.

 * Sedgwick Ave Display. This is an informal type of text used for the headings typically - I feel it is a suitable font for games.
 * Montserrat is used for the remainder of the text areas. This is  sans-serif font.
